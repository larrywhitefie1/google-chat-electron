An unofficial desktop app for [Google Chat](https://mail.google.com/chat/u/0/) built
with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/apps/google-chat-electron)

### Motivation

* Google has [shutdown](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/10194711) the official Google Chat Desktop App in March
  2021
* Google is forcing users to use PWA which has less features
* I am a Firefox user and don't want to install Chrome; just to use a PWA. :wink:

### Installation (Linux)

* Install via [snap](https://snapcraft.io/google-chat-electron) (recommended)

```bash
sudo snap install google-chat-electron

# grant permissions
sudo snap connect google-chat-electron:home :home
sudo snap connect google-chat-electron:removable-media :removable-media
```

* Alternatively you can download the latest debian installer from
  [releases](https://github.com/ankurk91/google-chat-electron/releases/latest) section
* Install the debian package with this command: (correct the file path yourself)

```bash
sudo apt install ~/path/to/google-chat-electron-xxx-amd64.deb
```

* :warning: Debian package does not have automatic background updates

### Uninstall (Linux)

* Logout and Quit from app
* Remove the app with this command if installed via snap

```bash
sudo snap remove google-chat-electron
```

or if installed via debian package

```bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge google-chat-electron
```

* The uninstallation script should remove all relevant files and folders.

### Installation (Mac)

* Homebrew users can run `brew install --cask google-chat-electron`

or

* Download the zip (darwin) file from [releases](https://github.com/ankurk91/google-chat-electron/releases/latest)
* Extract the zip file
* Move the app to your `~/Applications` folder
* Fix the permission issue with this command

```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ~/Applications/google-chat-electron.app
```

* Above command should fix the Mac-OS Gatekeeper [issue](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/262355/)

### Uninstall (Mac)

* Logout and Quit from app
* Move the app to trash

### Supported Platforms

The app should work on all platforms, but due to lack of time; we test on most popular only.
