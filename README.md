# google-chat-linux

An unofficial desktop client for Google Hangouts Chat. Created because Google didn't release one
for Linux even if the official one is just an Electron app.

### Known issues

Logging in spans multiple windows and eventually opens up the chat to the default browser. After that
this app works fine.
