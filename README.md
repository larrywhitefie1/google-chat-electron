# google-chat-linux

**Note**: I decide to move to another company that doesn't use Google Hangouts Chat. So I cannot go on maintaining this
project as I will not be able to test changes anymore. Hopefully someone will adopt this and keep developing it!

An unofficial desktop client for Google Hangouts Chat. Created because Google didn't release one
for Linux even if the official one is just an Electron app.

### Known issues

Logging in spans multiple windows and eventually opens up the chat to the default browser. After that
this app works fine.
Should be fixed in 0.0.2 but not fully tested yet.

### Installation

#### Debian-based distributions
You should download the latest .deb file from the [releases](https://github.com/robyf/google-chat-linux/releases) section and install it following the instructions here, for example: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/159094/how-to-install-a-deb-file-by-dpkg-i-or-by-apt

Note that this works only on Debian Linux or derivatives (Ubuntu, Mint, etc).


#### Arch Linux

There's an AUR package called google-chat-linux-git.
